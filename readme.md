## **🔐 Challenge Rules & Participation**

### **🛠️ Goal:**
Participants must **decrypt at least one of the encrypted test files** and prove it with a valid submission.

### **🚫 Restrictions:**
- ❌ **No brute force, rainbow tables, or precomputed attacks.**
- ✅ **Only analytical, pattern-based, or cryptanalysis methods allowed.**

### **❓ Why Are Brute Force & Other Attacks Not Allowed?**
NeurO Encryption is designed to be **resistant to traditional attack methods** due to its **dynamic folding structure, high entropy transformations, and AI-resistant encoding.** Here’s why these attacks won’t work:

🔹 **Standard brute-force methods are infeasible** due to the encryption's dynamic transformations and entropy layers.
🔹 **Dictionary-based decryption attempts will not succeed** as NeurO does not use password-based security.
🔹 **Precomputed attacks (such as Rainbow Tables) are ineffective**, as every encryption instance is uniquely randomized.


Instead, participants must rely on **pattern analysis, entropy evaluation, and cryptographic weaknesses (if any) to succeed.**

### **🏆 Rewards:**
- 🎖 **Leaderboard recognition** for those who make progress.
- 📜 **Acknowledgment in security research publications.**
- 💰 **Potential bounty for critical vulnerabilities (if funding allows).**
