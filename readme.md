## **🛠️ Test Cases & Attack Tools**

🔹 **Three Difficulty Levels:**  
- **Beginner:** Small text files encrypted with minimal folding.  
- **Intermediate:** Larger files with randomized keys and non-linear folding.  
- **Advanced:** Fully optimized Codex Folding with AI resistance enabled.  

🔹 **Provided Attack Tools:**  
- **Entropy Analysis Tool** (measure randomness and detect patterns).  
- **Pattern Detection Script** (analyze potential folding sequences).  
- **Sample Encrypted Messages** (compare known plaintext vs. ciphertext).

## **📢 How to Participate**

1️⃣ **Download the encrypted test cases from `/test_cases/`.**  
2️⃣ **Use your own cryptanalysis tools or the provided attack framework.**  
3️⃣ **If you successfully decrypt a file, submit your findings:**
   - The decrypted text.
   - Steps taken to break the encryption.
   - Any discovered weaknesses or patterns.

🔗 **Submission Form:** `/docs/submission.md` (to be added).
