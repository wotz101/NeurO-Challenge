**# Codex Folding Encryption Challenge - GitHub Launch Plan**

## **🚀 Objective**
We are launching a **public cryptographic challenge** to test the strength of **Codex Folding Encryption** against real-world attacks. The goal is to **invite security researchers, cryptographers, and AI experts** to attempt decryption using **analytical methods** while improving the encryption system based on real attack data.

## **🔐 Challenge Overview**
### **🛠️ Challenge Goal:**
**Decrypt one of the pre-encrypted test files** without having direct access to the encryption key. Participants must use **pattern analysis, AI cryptanalysis, or cryptographic techniques** to break it.

### **🚫 Rules & Restrictions:**
- ❌ **No brute force or dictionary attacks**—only intelligent analytical approaches.
- 🔄 **Any successful attack must be reproducible** with documentation.
- 🔍 **Modifications to the encryption code itself are NOT allowed** (only attack the encrypted data, not the algorithm itself).

### **🏆 Rewards & Leaderboard:**
- 🎖️ **Top contributors will be recognized** in the repo’s Hall of Fame.
- 📜 **Published research findings** will be credited for contributors.
- 💰 **Potential bounty for critical vulnerabilities** (if funding allows).

## **🛠️ Test Cases & Attack Tools**
**Three Difficulty Levels:**  
- **Beginner:** Small text files encrypted with simple parameters.  
- **Intermediate:** Larger files with randomized keys and non-linear folding.  
- **Advanced:** Fully optimized Codex Folding with AI resistance enabled.  

**Provided Attack Tools:**  
- **Pattern Analysis Scripts** for detecting folding patterns.  
- **Entropy & Complexity Measurement Tools** for statistical cryptanalysis.  
- **Sample Encrypted Messages** with known plaintext for correlation attacks.
